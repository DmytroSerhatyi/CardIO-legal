# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: November 15, 2025**

## 1. Overview
**CardIO** is developed and operated by Dmytro Serhatyi. It allows users to create, store, and manage various types of codes (QR, PDF417, Aztec, Code 128) locally on their device for personal use.

## 2. Data Collection
**CardIO** does **not collect, transmit, or store** personal data on external servers. All user-created data is stored locally on the device using **SwiftData** and **AppStorage**.

## 3. App Settings and State
**CardIO** may store small configuration details (e.g., sorting order or display preferences) locally. This information **never leaves the device**.

## 4. Camera Access
To scan codes, **CardIO** may use the device camera, **subject to the user granting permission**. **CardIO** does not access camera data beyond the scanning process.

## 5. Data Export and Import
**CardIO** may include export and import features so users can back up or share their data. These actions are fully user-controlled - once data leaves **CardIO**, its handling is users' responsibility.

## 6. Advertising
**CardIO** may display **non-personalized ads** through Google AdMob.
* AdMob does not use data from **CardIO** for personalized ad targeting.
* AdMob may process limited technical data (e.g., device type or approximate location from IP) to deliver and measure ads.
* **CardIO** does not enable tracking or share user data with advertisers.

For details, see Google’s Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy.

## 7. Cookies and Tracking
**CardIO** does **not** use cookies or similar tracking technologies directly. AdMob may use its own technologies to serve ads, as described in Google’s policy above.

## 8. Children’s Privacy
**CardIO** does not knowingly collect data from children. If users believe a child has shared data externally, please contact us for assistance.

## 9. Security
User data is stored only on the device and protected by system security features (e.g., passcode, Face ID, or encryption).

## 10. Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. The latest version will be available in the settings view of **CardIO** with a new "Last updated" date. Significant changes may be notified within **CardIO**.

## 11. Language Version Priority
In case of any discrepancies or inconsistencies between different language versions of this Policy, the English version shall prevail.
